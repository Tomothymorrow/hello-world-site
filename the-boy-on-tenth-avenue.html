<div class="content">
<p><strong>The Boy on Tenth Avenue</strong> is a gritty, emotionally charged tale set in 1980s Hell’s Kitchen — a neighborhood haunted by crime, legacy, and survival. The Westies ruled the streets, but this isn’t their story. It’s the story of a child watching from the curb.</p>

<p>Through the eyes of a young boy growing up in the shadow of the Irish mob, we witness the confusing intersections of loyalty, violence, and love. The boy isn't a gangster, but he lives where the rules are written by men who bleed for nothing and die for less.</p>

<p>It’s a coming-of-age story that doesn’t come with a celebration — just grit, memories, and a longing for something kinder. It's about what happens when you grow up surrounded by war, but all you want is a window and a way out.</p>
