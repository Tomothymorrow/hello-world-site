<div class="content">
<p><strong>Time Skizm</strong> is a 1990s alt-reality sci-fi thriller drenched in neon, paranoia, and fractured identity. In a world that feels familiar but operates on laws of glitching timelines and invisible watchers, a man named Juno uncovers the ripple that split reality — and possibly his mind.</p>

<p>Haunted by memories he never lived and followed by agents that don’t exist, Juno navigates a dystopian dreamscape trying to stitch together who he is, and why he was chosen to remember the fracture no one else can see.</p>

<p>What begins as a mystery becomes a war — between those who create time and those who survive its collapse.</p>

<p>Finalized and fully edited, <strong>Time Skizm</strong> is Tomothy Morrow’s grittiest, darkest, and most cinematic work to date.</p>
