<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p><em>Welcome to the official page of Tomothy Morrow, author of speculative fiction, poetic paradoxes, and deep futuristic tales.</em></p>
<h2>Meet Tomothy Morrow</h2>
<p>Tomothy Morrow is a writer of dreams, digital echoes, and time-twisting tales. From dusty typewriters to blinking cursors, his stories navigate the liminal spaces between what is and what might be. When he’s not writing, he’s probably thinking about writing — or rewriting reality in his mind.</p>
